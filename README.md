# Basic Financial Scraping tool open to anyone.
Note that this script can easily be improved. In the future, I plan on making this into a library.
But, overall this is a very basic Financial Data scraping script to get basic elements useful in modeling. If you would like to chip in or want additional features, please let me know! I'll be more than happy to add additional functionality.
