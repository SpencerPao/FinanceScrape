# Basic Financial Scraping Tool
Note that this script can easily be improved. In the future, I plan to convert this into a library if the demand is high enough.

But, overall this is a very basic Financial Data scraping script to get basic elements useful in modeling. If you would like to chip in or want additional features, please let me know! I'd be more than happy to add additional functionality. Just put a comment or issue.
